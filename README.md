##Features

- <b>Automatically</b> creates a sidebar style mobile menu

- <b>iOS 6</b> is tricked into using Hardware Acceleration. (It is disabled by default for some reason.)
- <b>Multi-Level Dropdowns</b> supported for both main & mobile navigation.
- <b>Great response times</b> due to a script that removed a 300ms standard delay on mobile devices.
- <b>Responsive iFrame</b> code included.
- <b>Includes</b> jQuery, jQuery Easing, jQuery Transit, & more.

##Requirements

- The responsive portions of this website require a recent version of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Opera. IE9+ should be mostly supported.
- The site must be built fluidly. (does not require horizontal scrollbars).
- In mobile view, the page content should preferably be longer than the navigation sidebar for best effect.
