#Responsive_Template
===================

##Description


This template is to be used as a starting point for developing responsive web designs. This is for front end developers who have a good understanding of how to build a site, and just prefer a starting point. Resize the demo on a computer to see the nav change, or just check it out on your mobile device.


##Demo
http://kthornbloom.com/rwd

##Features

- <b>Automatically</b> creates a sidebar style mobile menu
- <b>Examples included</b> for responsive slideshows, embedded content, photos, and tables.
- <b>Hardware Accelerated</b> CSS transitions used instead of jQuery animations to provide silky smooth effects.
- <b>iOS 6</b> is tricked into using Hardware Acceleration. (It is disabled by default for some reason.)
- <b>Multi-Level Dropdowns</b> supported for both main & mobile navigation.
- <b>Viewport Aware</b> dropdowns that always stay visible.
- <b>Improved response times</b> due to a script that removed a 300ms standard delay on mobile devices.
- <b>Includes</b> jQuery, jQuery Easing, jQuery Transit, & more.

##Requirements

- The responsive portions of this website require a recent version of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Opera. IE9+ should be mostly supported.(Old versions of IE should still work, but will be missing out on some of the responsive features.)
- The site must be built fluidly. (does not require horizontal scrollbars).
- In mobile view, the page content should preferably be longer than the navigation sidebar for best effect.
