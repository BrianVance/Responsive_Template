#RWD Template

##Description


This tool was built for my own front-end development projects. My goal was to include everything I need, and strip out anything I don't. This provides a lightweight starting point for web development.


##Demo

##Why is it Awesome?

- Add Multi-Level Nav Dropdowns with an unordered list.
- Velocity.js for faster animations.
- Automatically creates off-canvas mobile nav for small screens
- Includes Font Awesome 4
- Ready for many various responsive element types
- The mobile navigation animation uses CSS3 so it's silky smooth.
- Unlike other templates/boilerplates, it doesn't force you to use any particular layout method besides an unordered list for the navigation. Code how you want to!
- FREE for personal, professional, or other projects. Just don't attempt to resell this as-is

##Requirements

- The responsive portions of this website require a recent version of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or IE.
- The site must be built fluidly. (use max-width instead of width in your CSS).

##Licensing
Free to use & modify. If you end up using this template for something, shoot me a link! I'd love to see your work.
