#Responsive_Template
===================

##Template for Responsive Web Design

This is a basic set of HTML, CSS, and jQuery that can be used as a starting point for building responsive websites. It takes care of building the mobile navigation, but leaves the overall design up to you.

##Demo
http://kthornbloom.com/responsive-template

##Features

* Includes jQuery, jQuery Easing, jQuery Transit, & more.
* CSS reset
* Built-in script to copy the main nav & automatically build the mobile nav.
* Built-in 'sidebar' style mobile navigation.
* Hardware Accelerated CSS transitions used instead of jQuery animations to provide silky smooth effects.
* iOS 6 is tricked into using Hardware Acceleration. (It is diabled by default for some reason.)
* "Fastbutton" script to remove a 300ms delay on mobile devices.
* Responsive iFrames.

##Requirements

* The responsive portions of this website require a recent version of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Opera. IE9+ should be mostly supported.
* The site must be built fluidly. (does not require horizontal scrollbars).
